# Rainy House Simulation with OpenGL (Python)

This project is a simple **computer graphics simulation** built using Python and OpenGL.  
It displays a house under a rainy environment, where raindrops continuously fall and interact with the scene.  

## ✨ Features
- 🏠 Draws a house with roof, door, and windows using OpenGL primitives.  
- 🌧️ Simulates animated raindrops falling across the screen.  
- 🌗 Background toggle:
  - Press **`m`** → Morning mode (white background).  
  - Press **`n`** → Night mode (black background).  
- ↔️ House tilt control:
  - **Left Arrow** → Tilt left.  
  - **Right Arrow** → Tilt right.  

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- PyOpenGL  

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate

🎮 Controls

m → Morning mode

n → Night mode

← / → → Tilt house left or right
